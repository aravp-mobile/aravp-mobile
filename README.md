🌟 **Turning ideas into fast, reliable, and beautiful Android experiences.**  
I'm an Android engineer who enjoys digging deep into systems, solving unexpected issues, and building apps that just *feel right*. Whether it's a pixel off or a background service failing silently — I’m on it.

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🛠️ Build Android apps using **Kotlin**, **Jetpack**, and modern Android practices.
- 🧠 Fix hard-to-reproduce crashes, debug tricky APIs, and track performance bottlenecks.
- 📱 Focus on UI/UX polish, efficient architecture, and lifecycle-aware components.
- 🤝 Collaborate across teams to ship quality code — not just working code.

## 💡 Core Principles I Code By

🧩 **Understand the “why” behind the bug**  
Anyone can patch — I trace issues back to the root to ensure long-term fixes.

📦 **Modular & Maintainable**  
I structure code so that it grows cleanly with the product.

🚀 **Performance Matters**  
From cold start times to efficient RecyclerViews — I obsess over responsiveness.

🔄 **Never Stop Learning**  
Tech moves fast, and I move with it — whether it’s Jetpack Compose or CI/CD workflows.
